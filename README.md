# Divine Intervention
## Financial information when you need it the most

#### Problem
It is easy to exceed the credit limit or overdraft a debit card simply out of ignorance. Banks notify you only in the aftermath when they've charged the fees already - a situation that could have been avoided if only you knew about your low balances beforehand.

#### Solution
From now on, we will intervene every time you're about to overspend. The extension hides in the background and provides a timely warning whenever you're about to make a purchase that will exceed any of your financial limits. You can visualize how your balance will be affected by the purchase so that you can always make well-informed purchasing decisions.
