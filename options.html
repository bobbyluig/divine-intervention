    It is easy to exceed the credit limit or overdraft a debit card simply out of ignorance. 
    Banks notify you only in the aftermath when they've charged the fees already - a situation that
    could have been avoided if only you knew about your low balances. 
  </p>
  <p>
    From now on, we will intervene every time you're about to overspend.
    The extension hides in the background and provides a timely warning whenever you're about to make a purchase
    that will exceed any of your financial limits. You can visualize how your balance will be affected by the purchase
    so that you can always make well-informed purchasing decisions.
